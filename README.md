# WithU

## Description

Whether a ridesharing service or walking home alone at night begins to feel dangerous, WithU is always with you to make you feel safer. This program will allow you to choose from a selection of audio clips that replicate a phone call from a relative or friend. Each audio clip will display what the user should reply to imitate a real phone call. Browse from a selection of audios by language, relationship, location, and more. Save and download your favourite audios to gain quick access to them from the home screen.  
*Written in Python, using Tkinter framework*
